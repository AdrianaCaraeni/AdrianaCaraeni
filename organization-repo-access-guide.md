# Organization Repository Access Issues - Solutions Guide

## Common Problems and Solutions

### 1. **Repository Visibility and Permissions**

**Problem**: Can't see or access repositories in your organization
**Solutions**:
- Check if the repository is private and you have the necessary permissions
- Ask the organization owner/admin to add you to the specific repository or team
- Verify you've accepted the organization invitation (check your email)
- Go to your GitHub profile → Organizations → Click on the organization → Check your membership status

### 2. **Authentication Issues**

**Problem**: Can't push/pull from organization repositories
**Solutions**:
- **For HTTPS**: Ensure you're using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of password
  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin https://username:YOUR_PAT@github.com/org/repo.git
  ```
- **For SSH**: Make sure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account
  ```bash
  ssh -T git@github.com  # Test SSH connection
  ```

### 3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues**

**Problem**: Organization requires 2FA but you haven't enabled it
**Solutions**:
- Enable 2FA on your GitHub account: Settings → Password and authentication → Two-factor authentication
- Use an authenticator app or SMS
- Generate recovery codes and store them safely

### 4. **Organization Security Settings**

**Problem**: Organization has strict security policies
**Solutions**:
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)**: You may need to authorize your PAT/SSH key for SSO
  - Go to Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
  - Click "Enable SSO" next to your token for the organization
- **IP allowlists**: Ask admin to add your IP if the organization uses IP restrictions

### 5. **Repository-Specific Access Issues**

**Problem**: Can see the organization but not specific repositories
**Solutions**:
- Check if you're added to the right team that has access to the repository
- Repository might be archived or disabled
- Ask repository maintainer for explicit access

### 6. **Branch Protection and Push Issues**

**Problem**: Can clone but can't push to organization repository
**Solutions**:
- Check branch protection rules (main/master branch might be protected)
- Create a new branch and submit a pull request instead
- Ask for "Write" or "Admin" permissions if you need direct push access

### 7. **Organization Membership Issues**

**Problem**: Not showing as a member of the organization
**Solutions**:
- Check if your membership is set to "Public" (it might be private by default)
- Go to the organization page → People → Make your membership public
- Ensure you accepted the organization invitation

## Quick Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Organization Membership**:
   ```bash
   # Check your organizations via GitHub CLI (if installed)
   gh api user/orgs
   ```

2. **Check Repository Access**:
   ```bash
   # Try cloning the repository
   git clone https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY.git
   ```

3. **Test Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Test GitHub access
   git ls-remote https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY.git
   ```

4. **Check Current Git Configuration**:
   ```bash
   git config --list | grep user
   git config --list | grep credential
   ```

## What to Ask Your Organization Admin

If you're still having issues, ask your organization administrator:

1. "Can you verify I have access to the [repository-name] repository?"
2. "What is my role/permission level in the organization?"
3. "Are there any SSO or security requirements I need to complete?"
4. "Is there an IP allowlist I need to be added to?"
5. "Do I need to be added to a specific team for repository access?"

## Emergency Access Recovery

If you're completely locked out:
1. Contact the organization owner directly
2. Check if there's an organization email or support channel
3. Ask a colleague who has access to help you get re-added
4. Verify your GitHub account hasn't been compromised
